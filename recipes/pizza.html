        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 1kg bread flour</li>
            <li> 650ml water</li>
            <li> 20gr salt</li>
            <li> 1gr fresh yeast</li>
            <li> Extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li> Parmigiano Reggiano</li>
            <li> Mozarella</li>
            <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour, salt, and yeast in a large bowl and whisk until homogenous. Add water and incorporate into flour using hands until no dry flour remains on bottom of bowl. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and allow to rise at room temperature for 8 to 12 hours.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and divide into four even balls. Place each in a covered quart-sized deli container. Place in refrigerator and allow to rise at least 2 more days, and up to 4.  Remove from refrigerator, shape into balls, and allow to rest at room temperature for at least 2 hours before baking.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to the maximum temperature for 1 to 2 hours and use a baking steel or pizza stone if available</li>
            <li>After letting the dough ball rest on the counter for 2 hours, slowly stretch the dough ball out from the center to the crust without touching the crust in order to get a soft and airy crust.</li>
            <li>Quickly spread your tomato sauce, mozarella, a bit of parmigiano reggiano and a dash of olive oil on the pizza and put in in the oven.</li>
            <li>Bake until the crust has risen and the cheese has melted and quickly take it out of the oven. Another dash of extra virgin olive oil and fresh basil on top and it is ready to serve.</li>
        </ol>
